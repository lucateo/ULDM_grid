# This is the input file code; the first line are the parameters of the run: 
# num_fields: number of fields
# Nx:	
# Length: 
# dt_initial: initial time-step;
# numsteps: 
# outputnumb: number of 2D profile snapshots
# out_profile: number of radially averaged profile snapshots
# initial_cond: string which specifies the initial condition
# start_from_backup: if true, starts from a already saved run, with the same parameters mpi_string, Nx, Length, num_fields, initial_cond
# Example: a run of one field with a box of 128^3 points, whose length is 100 in grid units, initial dt=0.1, with 1000 time steps, snapshot of profile every 20 timesteps, snapshot of projected density every 40 timesteps, initial condition corresponding to stars_soliton, which does not start from a backup run 
#1 128 100 0.1 1000 20 40 stars_soliton false 
#
# The second line specify the parameters of the initial condition chosen, in this example, rc =5 and Nstars =100
#5 100
# 
# The third line are hyperparameters like the option for mpi, etc.; order:
#if mpi=1, sets the grid for mpi; if set3Dgrid=1, sets the output to be the full psi field, instead of just projected density, with resolution reduced by a factor reduce_grid; if outputPhase=1, it outputs a slice of the phase field
#nfields, Nx, L, dt, Nsteps, outN, outN_profile, name, backup
