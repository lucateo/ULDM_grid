# This is the input file code; the first line are the parameters of the run: 
# num_fields: number of fields
# Nx:	
# Length: 
# dt_initial: initial time-step;
# numsteps: 
# outputnumb: number of 2D profile snapshots
# out_profile: number of radially averaged profile snapshots
# initial_cond: string which specifies the initial condition
# start_from_backup: if true, starts from a already saved run, with the same parameters mpi_string, Nx, Length, num_fields, initial_cond
# Example: a run of one field with a box of 128^3 points, whose length is 100 in grid units, initial dt=0.1, with 1000 time steps, snapshot of profile every 20 timesteps, snapshot of projected density every 40 timesteps, initial condition corresponding to stars_soliton, which does not start from a backup run

2 128 100 0.1 1000 20 20 eddington_nfw_soliton false

# The second line specify the parameters of the initial condition chosen, in this example, rc =5 and Nstars =100
